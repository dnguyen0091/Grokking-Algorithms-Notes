#**Recursion**

#Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is often used to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.
#Think of it like Russian dolls where each doll contains a smaller one til you hit the smallest doll.
    #In recursion the base case would be the smallest doll, or the case where the function stops calling itself.
    #In recursion you basically traverse til you hit the base case, then you start returning back up the stack of function calls.
